This project aims to build and compare two machine learning models to predict diabetes based on various medical predictor variables. 
We will use Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to evaluate their performance on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. 
The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

  Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database consists of the following features:

preg: Number of times pregnant
plas: Plasma glucose concentration
pres: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
skin: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
test: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
mass: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
pedi: Diabetes pedigree function
age: Age (years)
target: 1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 otherwise
Steps Involved
Loading the Dataset
Data Preprocessing
Train-Test Split
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Model Comparison

Results
The results include the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification report for both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models. 
These metrics help us understand how well each model performs and where it might have weaknesses.

Conclusion
By comparing the performance of Logistic Regression(0.75) and Random Forest Classifier(0.72), 
  we can decide Logistic Regression model is better suited for predicting diabetes in this dataset.
  This project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in the machine learning pipeline.
